The yield estimate is also given to the seed farm at final inspection if it confirms the minimum standards at field level.</li><br>
                        <li>However, if the field does not confirm to the minimum standards, Liable for Rejection (LFR) report is issued to the seed grower under intimation of the Dy. Chief Seed Certification Officer. The issue of LFR is subject to confirmation of the Dy. Chief Seed Certification Officer after inspecting the field once again.</li><br>

                        </li><br>
                        <li>After processing is completed, samples are drawn sent to the Seed Testing Laboratory for analysis of Other Distinguishable Variety(ODV), Germination, Physical Purity etc.</li><br>
                        <li>On receipt of the Seed Analysis Report from the Seed Testing Lab, the Chief Seed Certification Officer intimates the result to the Producer for tagging of the seed lot and tagging should be completed within two months from the date of analysis in the presence of the SCO.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Finally, the producer lifts the tagged seed lots to the M/s PASIC, Puducherry for distribution to farmers through the PASIC depots.</li><br>
                        <li>The Chief Seed Certification Officer and Dy.
